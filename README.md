Currentsong
===========
Does exactly what it says on the tinâ€”Currentsong is a clean little app that sits
in your menu bar and displays the currently playing iTunes track.

There's also a stacked display if you prefer:

Click on the menu item to show full track info and change options:

I think you get the idea. [Download the .app here.](https://github.com/narze/Currentsong/raw/master/Binaries/Currentsong-1.2.zip)

About
-----
There are a few apps that show the current iTunes track in the menu bar, but
they're either half a decade old, ugly, packed with useless features, or
non-free. ($10 for an iTunes controller? Really?) And so a weekend project was
born.

Currentsong isn't an iTunes controller (the media keys work well enough) but I
could add play control to the menu if enough people want it.

I'd love to add support for other apps. Let me know if you want Currentsong to
support your favorite music player.
